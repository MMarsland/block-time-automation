### Updates:
#### Version 3.0:
Add the ability to use the extension from the "Week" view of google calendar.

#### Version 2.0:
Modifies the behavior of the extension to automatically map the times of the class based on the block letter and given date from the hardcoded rotation schedule.

### TODO:
#### Version 4.0:
- Convert an upload image of the schedule into a map for the block rotation (and save it in storage (options)) so the extension can be used every year without hardcoding
