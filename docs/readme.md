We may not even need this here we may be able to decode the shecudle upload in raw js

with 
let tempLink = document.createElement('a');
    tempLink.download = 'puppy-cropped.jpg';
    tempLink.href = document.getElementById('canvas').toDataURL("image/jpeg", 0.9);
    tempLink.click();

Cropping...
and
Tesserect.js
...
If we beak up the images into squares and by dates and then read each small image independently we might be able to make it work

Now can we run tesserect in pure js or do we need a node host on the website?...
